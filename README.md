## DOM Master
The library to help you manipulate the DOM. Get one line of code to do a 10 lines of vanilla JavaScript code. If jQuery is a little too hard for you, then this is your way out.
1. Easy installation
2. No dependencies
3. Tens of methods
4. Very simple and easy to use
5. Quite extensible (You can add your own methods)
6. Extremely recursive (Use many methods on one line Eg. `$$(...).method1().method2().method3().methodn()`).
7. Well documented/commented for auto completion
8. Can be used by node modules and cdn
